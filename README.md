Beginner level is basic stuff you can inform yourself about anywhere.
Intermediate is applicable knowledge where it is much harder to find good models and processes.
Advanced this stuff is your own personal knowdledge base. 

Different types of learning environments: 
As a self taught person: Accepting only the stuff that makes sense.
